# React Native Uninitialized State Variable Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution to correctly handle the uninitialized state.

## Problem

Accessing state properties before they are populated can lead to runtime errors, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or complex data structures. This example highlights the issue and presents a clear solution.

## Solution

The provided solution includes conditional rendering or nullish coalescing to gracefully handle the case where the state variable is still undefined or null.
