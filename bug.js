This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens within a component's render method before the component has completed mounting. For example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null // Initially null
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text> {/* Error if data is null */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

Accessing `this.state.data.someProperty` will throw an error if `this.state.data` is null or undefined during rendering.
